This is a simple version of the Pipex project from 42 curriculum

It recreates the basic functionalities of bash shell - execution of 2 commands and redirecting input from one file to another with the use of a pipe

In order to give it a try ```make``` an executable and run it with four parameters: ```./pipex infile cmd1 cmd2 outfile```

It will mimic the behaviour of bash command given as follows: ```< infile cmd1 | cmd2 > outfile```

Feel free to reach out if you notice any errors or have improvements to suggest

The second pipex repo is my attempt at bonus requirements (supporting multiple commands and heredoc) - as of now unfinished
